# Jesse Monks Coding Challange

Test your knowledge on html and css with this coding challange. Each game will start with 25 seconds on the clock, with each correct answer you will move on to the next question. With every incorrect answer a penalty of -10 seconds will occure and you will have to attempt to answer the question correctly again. When time is up you will get a game over, if you pass through all the questions without having time run out you will gain points equal to the remainder of your time.
